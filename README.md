## Considered Challenges
- The contents (text in Alert) might be empty
the term might be as part of a combined word for example the term of <mark >ig metall</mark > is as a part of rechtswidrig metall which in this code it is not be considered.
- 



- IG-Metall is in the list but based on asked solution in case of *keepOrder = True* we should find just this term without any changes lik "IG Metall" as it is in *testQueryTerm*
- There are a consequent words like rechtswird*ig metall* and I don't know should I consider as "IG Metall" finding or not?
- capital letter and small letters should be considred?
